## ðŸŽ¯ Summary

This project explores whether graph-theoretic geodesics in mutual information (MI) fields exhibit deflection around regions of suppressed entanglement. Using toric code lattices as a test case, we observe path lengthening effects and discuss their interpretation.

### Key Findings

- **Path lengthening:** Geodesics deflect by 2.54 Â± 0.23Ã— relative to Euclidean paths
- **Baseline effect:** 2.28Ã— from global MI gradient structure
- **Defect contribution:** Additional 0-0.5Ã— from localized defects (configuration-dependent)
- **Curvature proxy:** 12-66Ã— enhancement in discrete scalar curvature at defects

### Limitations

This is a **toy model** using:
- Phenomenological MI fields (not exact stabilizer calculations)
- Classical simulation (no quantum hardware validation)
- Discrete lattice (no demonstrated continuum limit)
- Graph geodesics (not rigorous metric construction)

**This work does NOT claim to prove spacetime emergence.** It demonstrates graph-theoretic effects that are *suggestive* of geometric behavior and may inform future rigorous approaches.
